## Practical Task 6: Set Up a Scalable Web Server with VM, Storage, and Networking

1. Create a Resource Group
    - Use Azure CLI to create a resource group named WebServerGroup in the East US region.
2. Deploy a Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnet
    - Use Azure CLI to create a virtual network named WebVNet in WebServerGroup.
    - Add a subnet named WebSubnet.
3. Create a Storage Account for Logs
    - Use Azure PowerShell to create a storage account named webserverlogs in WebServerGroup.

5. Install and Configure Nginx on the VM
    - Use Azure CLI to execute a script on WebVM that installs and configures Nginx as a web server.
6. Enable Diagnostics and Store Logs in Storage Account
    - Use Azure PowerShell to enable diagnostics on WebVM, directing logs to webserverlogs storage account.
7. Verify the Web Server is Running
    - Retrieve the public IP of WebVM using Azure CLI.
    - Access the Nginx default page from a web browser using ```http://<Public-IP>```.
8. Clean Up Resources
    - Delete all created resources (WebVM, webserverlogs, WebVNet, WebServerGroup) using both Azure CLI and PowerShell.
